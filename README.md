# NYC Green Taxi Fare Prediction and Congestion Impact Analysis  
**A Geospatial Machine Learning Project | Kent State University Capstone**

##  Overview
This project investigates how **traffic congestion** impacts **taxi fare prices and trip durations** across different neighborhoods and time windows in New York City. Developed as part of a university capstone at Kent State, the study explores spatial-temporal congestion patterns and builds machine learning models to predict total fare amounts.

We used historical **NYC Green Taxi Trip Data (2022)** and applied regression-based models to understand and quantify the effect of congestion across zones.

##  Business Objective
The project addresses this core question:

> **How does traffic congestion affect trip duration and taxi fares across NYC neighborhoods and times of day?**

This has practical implications for:
- **Urban planners** to reduce congestion hotspots
- **Taxi operators** to reroute and optimize pricing
- **Passengers** to make informed travel decisions

##  Key Techniques & Methodology

| Stage                  | Approach                                                                 |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Collection        | Imported NYC Green Taxi 2022 dataset                                     |
| Data Processing        | Cleaned timestamps, extracted trip metrics, mapped congestion zones      |
| Spatial Analysis       | Identified zones with highest average fare and trip time                 |
| Temporal Analysis      | Visualized hourly variations in fare, duration, congestion surcharge     |
| Feature Engineering    | Created distance, duration, and surcharge-based features                 |
| Modeling Approaches    | Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest                          |
| Evaluation Metrics     | MSE, MAE, RÂ² Score                                                        |
| Model Comparison       | Random Forest yielded the best performance (lowest MSE, highest RÂ²)      |

##  Sample Insights

- Neighborhoods like zone `82`, `153`, and `191` had the **highest congestion-related fare increases**
- Congestion surcharge had a **moderate correlation** with total fare, but weak correlation with trip duration
- Fares and trip times **peaked during evening rush hours**, especially on weekdays

##  Models & Results

| Model            | MSE      | MAE     | RÂ² Score |
|------------------|----------|---------|----------|
| Linear Regression| High     | High    | Low      |
| Decision Tree    | Moderate | Moderate| ~0.32    |
| Random Forest    | **Lowest**| Best   | Best     |

Random Forest achieved the best predictive accuracy by capturing non-linear interactions between congestion zones and fare pricing.
